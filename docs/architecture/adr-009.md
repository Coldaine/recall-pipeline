# ADR-009: Pure Rust End-to-End Stack

## Status
Active (Supersedes ADR-002)

## Context
We initially considered a hybrid architecture (Rust capture + Python orchestration).

## Decision
**Rust for everything in production.** Python is for reference prototyping only.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Single toolchain, no IPC overhead, easy deployment.
- **Negative**: Must reimplement MIRIX logic in Rust.
