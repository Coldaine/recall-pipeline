# ADR-003: PostgreSQL Only (No SQLite)

## Status
Active

## Context
Previous attempts with SQLite failed due to high write contention during screen capture.

## Decision
**Use PostgreSQL as the single source of truth.** No local SQLite database.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: High concurrency, distinct server/client separation, robust ecosystem.
- **Negative**: Requires a running Postgres instance (Docker/Cloud).
