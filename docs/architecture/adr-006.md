# ADR-006: Windows 11 First

## Status
Active

## Context
Cross-platform capture is hard.

## Decision
**Target Windows 11 for the MVP.** Mac/Linux support is deferred.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Faster MVP delivery, leverage Windows-specific optimizations.
- **Negative**: Limited user base initially (User only uses Windows currently).
