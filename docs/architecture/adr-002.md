# ADR-002: Rust for Core Infrastructure; Python for Agents

## Status
**Accepted** (Originally ADR-009, renumbered 2026-02-14)

## Decision
**Rust is the production runtime for Core Infrastructure (Capture, Storage, Orchestration).** High-level agentic logic (like the MIRIX system) is permitted to remain in Python to leverage the rich AI/LLM ecosystem.

## Alternatives Considered
- **Pure Rust End-to-End**: Port everything. Rejected because Python's LLM library support (LangChain, Pydantic, etc.) is superior for agentic experimentation.
- **Python-only Core**: Non-starter for the capture hot path.

## Consequences
- The `capture/` and `storage/` layers must be Rust.
- The `agents/` layer is a first-class citizen in Python.
- IPC between Rust (Core) and Python (Agent) is via the shared PostgreSQL database.
- A unified build system (likely `just` + `uv`) must handle both ecosystems.
