# ADR-008: Gradual Extraction

## Status
Active

## Context
Refactoring the entire codebase is risky.

## Decision
**Extract components one by one** (Database → Capture → Agents). Safety > Speed.

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Incremental value, lower risk of breakage.
- **Negative**: Temporary duplication or hybrid states (though Python is now ref-only).
